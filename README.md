FP4 - Formative #2 - Pygame

Pygame is all about objects. Surface contains the image, while Rect provides size and position details, but Sprite controls all movement operations. An object possesses its information while maintaining built-in functions that include update() and move_ip(). Our lesson created a Ball class to enable ball motion and self-drawing functions, which maintained a neat main loop design. Buried lists for positions, along with images, result in quick disarray. The game remains simple to maintain and increase through object-based organization.
